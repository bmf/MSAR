## V3 Schema: Team Memberships ✅

Users are properly assigned to teams in the v3 schema:

### Maintenance Team Alpha (Contract: Navy Maintenance Contract - NMC-2025)

| Email | Full Name | Role in Team | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| teamlead@example.com | Team Lead User | **lead** | ✅ |
| member1@example.com | Team Member One | **member** | ✅ |

**Note:** member2@example.com is NOT in team_memberships yet. This is acceptable for testing but may need to be added for comprehensive multi-user tests.

---

## V3 Schema: User Contract Roles ✅

Users have proper role assignments per contract:

### Navy Maintenance Contract (NMC-2025)

| Email | Full Name | Role | Status |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|
| approver@example.com | Report Approver User | **PM** | ✅ |
| teamlead@example.com | Team Lead User | **Team Lead** | ✅ |
| member1@example.com | Team Member One | **Team Member** | ✅ |

### Fleet Support Services (FSS-2025)

| Email | Full Name | Role | Status |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|
| approver@example.com | Report Approver User | **PM** | ✅ |

**Note:** Admin user (flade@falconwood.biz) doesn't need contract-specific roles as Admin has unrestricted access.

---

## Task Assignments ✅

Test users have task assignments:

### member1@example.com
- **Task:** Phase 4 Test Task
- **Status:** in-progress
- **PWS Code:** 4.1.1.2
- **PWS Title:** Maintenance Planning
- **Contract:** Navy Maintenance Contract
- **Status:** ✅ Has at least one assigned task

### teamlead@example.com
- **Status:** ⚠️ No tasks assigned (acceptable - leads review, don't necessarily have tasks)

### member2@example.com
- **Status:** ⚠️ No tasks assigned (may need for comprehensive testing)

---

## Task Statuses (Phase 5 Schema) ✅

**Current State:** No task_statuses submissions exist yet

This is **EXPECTED** and **CORRECT** because:
1. The migration script hasn't been applied yet
2. No users have submitted statuses using the new schema
3. Tests will create submissions during execution

**Action Required:** None - this is the clean starting state for Phase 5 testing

---

## Summary: Ready for Phase 5 Testing ✅

### What's Working ✅
- ✅ All 5 test users exist with correct credentials
- ✅ Users have appropriate roles in profiles table
- ✅ Team Lead and Member 1 are on the same team (Maintenance Team Alpha)
- ✅ User contract roles properly configured for v3 schema
- ✅ Member 1 has at least one task assigned
- ✅ task_statuses table is clean (ready for new submissions)

### Minor Gaps (Non-Blocking) ⚠️
- ⚠️ member2@example.com not in team_memberships (optional for basic tests)
- ⚠️ member2@example.com has no task assignments (optional for basic tests)
- ⚠️ teamlead@example.com has no task assignments (acceptable - leads review)

### Recommendations

#### For Basic Phase 5 Testing (Current State is Sufficient)
The current setup is **sufficient** for testing:
- Report-month handling (member1 can submit)
- Duplicate prevention (member1 can test)
- Review queue (teamlead can review member1's submissions)
- Auto-queue feature (teamlead approves → queues)

#### For Comprehensive Multi-Assignee Testing (Optional Enhancement)
To fully test multi-assignee features, consider:

```sql
-- Add member2 to the team
INSERT INTO team_memberships (team_id, user_id, role_in_team)
SELECT 
    t.id,
    au.id,
    'member'
FROM teams t
CROSS JOIN auth.users au
WHERE t.name = 'Maintenance Team Alpha'
  AND au.email = 'member2@example.com';

-- Create a multi-assignee task
INSERT INTO tasks (pws_line_item_id, title, description, status_short, is_active)
SELECT 
    pwsl.id,
    'Multi-Assignee Test Task',
    'Task with multiple assignees for Phase 5 testing',
    'not-started',
    true
FROM pws_line_items pwsl
WHERE pwsl.code = '4.1.1.2'
RETURNING id;

-- Assign to both member1 and member2
-- (Replace [TASK_ID] with the id from above)
INSERT INTO task_assignments (task_id, user_id, assigned_by)
SELECT 
    '[TASK_ID]'::uuid,
    au.id,
    (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'teamlead@example.com')
FROM auth.users au
WHERE au.email IN ('member1@example.com', 'member2@example.com');
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Apply Migration ✅ Ready
The database is ready for the Phase 5 migration:
```
database/migrations/0013_migrate_updates_to_task_statuses.sql
```

### 2. Run Tests ✅ Ready
Execute Phase 5 tests:
```bash
npm test -- tests/phase5.spec.js
```

### 3. Expected Test Behavior
- **member1@example.com** can submit task status
- **teamlead@example.com** can review and approve/reject
- Duplicate prevention will work for member1's task
- Multi-assignee badge will show if multi-assignee tasks exist
- Auto-queue will add approved statuses to report_queue

---

## Database Health Check ✅

- ✅ All required tables exist (contracts, teams, team_memberships, tasks, task_assignments, user_contract_roles)
- ✅ Foreign key relationships intact
- ✅ Test data properly structured
- ✅ No orphaned records
- ✅ Ready for Phase 5 migration

---

**Verification Status:** ✅ PASSED - Database is ready for Phase 5 testing

**Verified:** All test users exist with appropriate roles and assignments. The database structure supports all Phase 5 features.
