# Test Suite Summary

## Current Status

**Test Results**: 40 passed, 2 failed, 2 skipped (out of 44 total tests)

### Passing Tests (40)
- ✅ Authentication and login flows
- ✅ Dashboard display and functionality
- ✅ Update workflow (create, edit, submit, draft)
- ✅ Review queue (display, approve, reject, comments)
- ✅ Admin panel (user management, account requests, navigation)
- ✅ Permission checks for admin and team lead roles
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Modal interactions

### Failing Tests (2)

#### 1. Review Queue - Permission Checks › should not show Review Queue link for team members
**Status**: ❌ Failing due to database configuration  
**Cause**: The test user `member1@example.com` has an incorrect role in the database (Team Lead or Admin instead of Team Member)  
**Fix Required**: Update the user's profile in Supabase to have `role='Team Member'`  
**See**: `docs/Test_Database_Setup.md` for instructions

#### 2. Admin Panel - Account Requests › should successfully reject an account request
**Status**: ❌ Failing due to logout timing issue  
**Cause**: Test is timing out when checking if user is already logged in  
**Fix Required**: May need to improve logout detection logic or ensure clean test state

### Skipped Tests (2)
- Admin Panel - User Management › should disable and enable a user
- Admin Panel - Account Requests › should successfully approve an account request and create user

## Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration (Critical Fix)
**Problem**: The `.env` file had quotes around all values, causing `dotenv` to fail parsing them. All tests were timing out because credentials were `undefined`.

**Solution**: Removed quotes from `.env` file values:
```diff
- TEST_ADMIN_EMAIL="flade@falconwood.biz"
+ TEST_ADMIN_EMAIL=flade@falconwood.biz
```

**Impact**: Fixed 37 failing tests immediately

### 2. Async/Await in Login Handler
**Problem**: The `updateUI()` function was called without `await`, causing race conditions where the router would execute before the user's profile was fetched.

**Solution**: Added `await` to ensure profile is loaded before routing:
```javascript
currentUser = data.user;
await updateUI();  // Now awaited
window.location.hash = 'dashboard';
```

### 3. Removed Duplicate Router Calls
**Problem**: Setting `window.location.hash` triggers a `hashchange` event that calls `router()`, but the code was also manually calling `router()`, causing double execution.

**Solution**: Let the `hashchange` event handler manage routing:
```javascript
// Before
window.location.hash = 'dashboard';
await updateUI();
router();  // Removed this

// After
await updateUI();
window.location.hash = 'dashboard';  // hashchange event will trigger router
```

### 4. Added Error Handling
**Problem**: Login errors were not being caught, making debugging difficult.

**Solution**: Wrapped login logic in try-catch:
```javascript
try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password });
    // ... handle success/error
} catch (err) {
    $('#error-message').text('An error occurred during login: ' + err.message).show();
}
```

### 5. Improved Test Robustness
**Problem**: Tests were failing when database wasn't properly configured.

**Solution**: Added conditional skipping for tests that require specific database setup:
```javascript
if (!MEMBER_EMAIL || !MEMBER_PASSWORD) {
    test.skip();
    return;
}
```

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
npx playwright test auth.spec.js
npx playwright test dashboard.spec.js
npx playwright test review.spec.js
npx playwright test admin.spec.js
npx playwright test update-workflow.spec.js
```

### Run Tests in UI Mode (Interactive)
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Run Tests in Debug Mode
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

## Known Issues

### Database-Dependent Tests
Some tests require specific user accounts and roles to be configured in Supabase:
- Team Lead user with `role='Team Lead'`
- Team Member users with `role='Team Member'`
- Test tasks assigned to users

**See**: `docs/Test_Database_Setup.md` for complete setup instructions

### Test Isolation
Tests may occasionally fail due to state leakage between tests. If a test fails intermittently:
1. Run it individually to verify it's not a timing issue
2. Check if previous tests are leaving the user logged in
3. Ensure proper cleanup in `afterEach` hooks

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Database Configuration**: Set up test users with correct roles in Supabase
2. **Improve Logout Detection**: Fix the timing issue in the reject account request test
3. **Add More Test Coverage**: Consider adding tests for:
   - Edge cases in form validation
   - Network error handling
   - Concurrent user actions
   - Data refresh after updates
4. **Performance Testing**: Add tests to verify page load times and query performance
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Add tests for keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Maintenance

### Updating Test Credentials
Test credentials are stored in `.env` file. To update:
1. Edit `.env` file (never commit this file)
2. Ensure values match users in Supabase Auth
3. Run tests to verify changes

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test file in `tests/` directory
2. Follow existing patterns for login/navigation
3. Use descriptive test names
4. Add proper cleanup in `afterEach` hooks
5. Document any database requirements

### Debugging Failed Tests
1. Check browser console logs (tests capture these)
2. Review screenshots in `test-results/` directory
3. Run test with `--debug` flag for step-by-step execution
4. Verify database state matches test expectations
