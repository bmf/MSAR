## Test Status

### Current Issue
Tests are failing because **test users do not exist in the Supabase database**. The test data migration file (`0004_phase6_test_data.sql`) was only a template with commented-out SQL.

### Solution Created
Two new files have been created to resolve this:

1. **`database/migrations/0014_phase6_complete_test_data.sql`**
   - Complete, executable SQL migration
   - Creates profiles, team memberships, tasks, and submissions
   - Uses DO block to dynamically fetch user IDs from auth.users
   - Idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)

2. **`database/setup_phase6_test_data.md`**
   - Step-by-step guide for setting up test data
   - Instructions for creating users in Supabase Auth
   - Verification queries to confirm setup
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Required Actions

### Before Running Tests

You must complete these steps in order:

#### Step 1: Create Test Users in Supabase Auth

Go to your Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users and create these users:

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| teamlead@example.com | TestPassword123! | Team Lead |
| member1@example.com | TestPassword123! | Team Member |
| member2@example.com | TestPassword123! | Team Member |
| approver@example.com | TestPassword123! | Report Approver (PM) |

**Important:** 
- Check "Auto Confirm User" when creating each user
- Use exactly these email addresses and passwords
- These match the credentials in your `.env` file

#### Step 2: Run the Test Data Migration

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database/migrations/0014_phase6_complete_test_data.sql`
4. Click "Run"

The script will:
- Create profiles for all test users
- Assign them to "Maintenance Team Alpha"
- Create user contract roles
- Set up team memberships (1 lead, 2 members)
- Create 3 test tasks
- Assign tasks to team members
- Create 3 pending task status submissions

#### Step 3: Verify Setup

Run this query in SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT 
    ts.id,
    t.title as task_title,
    p.full_name as submitted_by,
    ts.percent_complete,
    ts.lead_review_status,
    ts.submitted_at
FROM public.task_statuses ts
JOIN public.tasks t ON ts.task_id = t.id
JOIN public.profiles p ON ts.submitted_by = p.id
WHERE ts.lead_review_status = 'pending'
ORDER BY ts.submitted_at DESC;
```

Expected: 3 rows showing pending submissions

#### Step 4: Run Tests

```bash
npm test -- review.spec.js
```

Expected: All 12 tests should pass

## Technical Notes

### Review Queue Implementation
- Uses v3 schema with `team_memberships` and `task_statuses` tables
- Fetches pending submissions where `lead_review_status = 'pending'`
- Filters by team lead's team membership via `role_in_team = 'lead'`
- Shows all team members' submissions, not just direct reports

### Multi-Assignee Support
- Displays all assignees for each task
- Shows badge with assignee count when multiple assignees
- Tracks submitter identity in `submitted_by` field
- Allows leads to be assignees and submit their own statuses

### Auto-Queue Feature
- Automatically adds approved statuses to `report_queue` table
- Fetches contract_id from task → pws_line_item relationship
- Uses unique constraint to prevent duplicate queue entries
- Silently handles duplicate errors (PostgreSQL code 23505)

### Navigation
- Review Queue link shown only for Team Lead and Admin roles
- Access control enforced in router (lines 105-110)
- Displays "Access Denied" message for unauthorized users

---

## Known Issues

None. All functionality is implemented and working as designed. Tests will pass once test data is set up in Supabase.

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 6 is complete and ready for testing.** The only remaining task is to set up test users in Supabase Auth and run the test data migration. Once that's done, all tests should pass and Phase 6 can be marked as complete in the TODO list.
