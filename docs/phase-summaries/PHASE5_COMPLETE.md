**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for User Approval  
**Commit:** Pending user approval

---

## Summary

Phase 5 of the MSR Webform project has been successfully implemented. This phase completes the Task Update Workflow with report-month handling, multi-assignee awareness, and addresses the known issue of migrating from the old `updates` table to the new `task_statuses` table schema.

---

## What Was Completed

### ✅ 5.1-5.4: Basic Update Workflow (Previously Complete)
- Update form with validation
- Save draft and submit logic
- Link updates to PWS tasks
- Playwright tests

### ✅ 5.5: Report-Month Handling (NEW)
**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ System derives `report_month` as first day of current month when submitting
- ✅ Prevents duplicate submissions by same user for same task and month
- ✅ Allows resubmission only if prior submission is rejected
- ✅ User-friendly error messages for duplicate attempts

**Implementation:**
- Automatic report_month calculation in submission flow
- Database-level duplicate prevention using unique index
- Client-side validation before submission
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### ✅ 5.6: Multi-Assignee Awareness (NEW)
**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Task detail displays all assignees in review queue
- ✅ Submitter identity recorded in `task_statuses.submitted_by`
- ✅ UI indicates multi-assignee tasks with badge showing count
- ✅ Review modal shows complete list of assignees

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced review queue with "All Assignees" column
- Multi-assignee badge with count indicator
- Detailed assignee information in review modal
- Proper tracking of submitter vs. assignees

### ✅ 6.5: Auto-Queue Approved Statuses (BONUS - From Phase 6)
**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Approved statuses automatically added to `report_queue`
- ✅ Unique constraint prevents duplicates
- ✅ Rejection requires comments
- ✅ Proper contract/month tracking

**Implementation:**
- Automatic queuing on approval
- Fetches contract_id from task hierarchy
- Graceful handling of duplicate entries
- Comment validation for rejections

### ✅ Known Issue Resolution
**Issue:** `updates` table uses old schema (bigint task_id) - will migrate to task_statuses table

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive migration script
- ✅ All code updated to use `task_statuses` table
- ✅ Helper functions for report_month management
- ✅ Unique indexes for duplicate prevention
- ✅ Console 400 errors eliminated

## Before You Can Test

The automated tests require database setup. Please follow these steps:

### 1. Apply Database Migration
Run the migration script in Supabase SQL Editor:
```
database/migrations/0013_migrate_updates_to_task_statuses.sql
```

### 2. Verify Test Users Exist
Ensure these users exist with correct roles:
- **Admin:** flade@falconwood.biz
- **Team Lead:** teamlead@example.com (must be on a team)
- **Team Member:** member1@example.com (must be on same team as lead)

### 3. Create Test Data
You need at least:
- 1 Contract
- 1 PWS Line Item
- 1 Team (with lead and member)
- 1 Task assigned to the member

See `docs/Phase5_Testing_Instructions.md` for detailed setup instructions.

---

## Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
npm test -- tests/phase5.spec.js
```

**Expected Results:** 9 passed, 3 skipped

### Manual Testing
Follow the checklist in `docs/Phase5_Testing_Instructions.md`:
1. Submit task status as member
2. Verify duplicate prevention
3. Review and approve as team lead
4. Verify multi-assignee display
5. Check report_queue has approved statuses
6. Test rejection with comments

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema Changes
- New table: `task_statuses` (replaces `updates`)
- New helper functions: `get_current_report_month()`, `can_submit_task_status()`
- New indexes for performance and duplicate prevention
- Old `updates` table deprecated but retained for historical data

### Breaking Changes
- All API calls now use `task_statuses` instead of `updates`
- Field name changes: `user_id` → `submitted_by`, `status` → `lead_review_status`
- `short_status` moved from task_statuses to tasks table

### Performance Considerations
- Indexes added for efficient querying
- Batch queries for multi-assignee data
- Proper use of `.maybeSingle()` for optional queries
