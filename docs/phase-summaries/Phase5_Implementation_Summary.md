# Phase 5 Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Phase:** Task Update Workflow - Report-Month Handling & Multi-Assignee Awareness

---

## Overview

Phase 5 completes the task update workflow by implementing report-month handling with duplicate prevention and multi-assignee awareness. This phase also addresses the known issue of migrating from the old `updates` table to the new `task_statuses` table schema.

---

## Completed Features

### 5.5: Report-Month Handling ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ System derives `report_month` as first day of current month when submitting status
- ✅ Prevents duplicate submissions by same user for same task and month
- ✅ Allows resubmission only if prior submission is Draft or Rejected

**Implementation Details:**
- Added automatic report_month calculation in `saveUpdate()` function
- Implemented duplicate check before submission using `task_statuses` table query
- Query checks for existing pending/approved submissions for the same task/user/month combination
- User-friendly error message displayed when duplicate submission is attempted

**Code Changes:**
- `public/src/app.js` lines 680-697: Report month calculation and duplicate prevention logic

### 5.6: Multi-Assignee Awareness ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Task detail displays all assignees in review queue
- ✅ Submitter identity recorded in `task_statuses.submitted_by`
- ✅ UI indicates if lead is also an assignee
- ✅ Multi-assignee badge shows count of assignees

**Implementation Details:**
- Enhanced review queue to fetch all task assignments
- Added "All Assignees" column to review table
- Implemented multi-assignee badge showing assignee count
- Added multi-assignee alert in review modal with full list of assignees
- Properly tracks submitter identity separate from assignee list

**Code Changes:**
- `public/src/app.js` lines 1430-1512: Enhanced `fetchPendingSubmissions()` with multi-assignee data
- `public/src/app.js` lines 1320-1327: Updated review table headers
- `public/src/app.js` lines 1523-1537: Enhanced table rendering with multi-assignee badges
- `public/src/app.js` lines 1557-1570: Added multi-assignee info to review modal

### 6.5: Auto-Queue Approved Statuses ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ On Approve, row added to `report_queue` for (contract_id, report_month, task_status_id)
- ✅ Unique constraint prevents duplicates
- ✅ Rejection requires comment

**Implementation Details:**
- Implemented automatic queuing when lead approves a task status
- Fetches contract_id from task's PWS line item
- Inserts into `report_queue` table with proper error handling
- Silently handles duplicate errors (unique constraint)
- Enforces comment requirement for rejections

**Code Changes:**
- `public/src/app.js` lines 1648-1681: Auto-queue implementation in `processReview()`

---

## Schema Migration

### Known Issue Addressed ✅

**Issue:** `updates` table uses old schema (bigint task_id) referencing `pws_tasks`

**Resolution:**
- Created migration script `0013_migrate_updates_to_task_statuses.sql`
- Deprecated old `updates` table with comment
- Added helper functions for report_month handling
- Implemented unique index to prevent duplicate submissions
- All code now uses `task_statuses` table with proper UUID references

**Migration File:** `database/migrations/0013_migrate_updates_to_task_statuses.sql`

**Key Changes:**
- Added `get_current_report_month()` helper function
- Added `can_submit_task_status()` helper function for duplicate checking
- Created partial unique index on `task_statuses` for pending/approved submissions
- Added indexes for efficient querying by status and month

---

## Code Updates

- Updated to fetch from `task_statuses` instead of `updates`
- Filters for approved statuses only
- Properly maps status fields to display format

### Admin Dashboard (`initializeAdminDashboard`)
- Updated to use `task_statuses` table
- Fetches latest approved status for each task
- Displays multi-assignee information

### Review Queue (`initializeReviewQueue`)
- Complete rewrite to use `task_statuses` schema
- Enhanced with multi-assignee awareness
- Added PWS line item column
- Improved submission details display
- Implemented auto-queue feature

### Update Form (`saveUpdate`)
- Added report_month calculation
- Implemented duplicate submission prevention
- Updates task's `status_short` field
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### Review Process (`processReview`)
- Updated to work with `task_statuses` table
- Implements approve/approve-with-changes/reject workflow
- Auto-queues approved statuses to `report_queue`
- Enforces comment requirement for rejections
- Updates lead review fields (reviewer, reviewed_at, comment)

---

## Testing

### Test File Created
**File:** `tests/phase5.spec.js`

### Test Coverage
1. **Report-Month Handling**
   - Derives report_month correctly
   - Prevents duplicate submissions
   - Allows resubmission after rejection (placeholder)

2. **Multi-Assignee Awareness**
   - Displays all assignees in review queue
   - Shows multi-assignee badge
   - Displays multi-assignee info in modal
   - Records submitter identity

3. **Auto-Queue Feature**
   - Adds approved status to report_queue
   - Requires comments for rejection

4. **Form Validation**
   - Validates required fields
   - Validates percent complete range

5. **Dashboard Display**
   - Shows latest approved status

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test -- tests/phase5.spec.js
```

---

## Database Schema Changes

### New Helper Functions
```sql
-- Get current report month (first day of month)
get_current_report_month() RETURNS date

-- Check if user can submit status for task/month
can_submit_task_status(task_id uuid, user_id uuid, report_month date) RETURNS boolean
```

### New Indexes
```sql
-- Prevent duplicate pending/approved submissions
idx_task_statuses_unique_submission ON task_statuses (task_id, submitted_by, report_month)
WHERE lead_review_status IN ('pending', 'approved')

-- Efficient querying by status and month
idx_task_statuses_status_month ON task_statuses (lead_review_status, report_month)
```

---

## Breaking Changes

### API Changes
- All references to `updates` table replaced with `task_statuses`
- Field name changes:
  - `user_id` → `submitted_by`
  - `status` → `lead_review_status`
  - `created_at` → `submitted_at` (for submission time)
  - `short_status` removed from task_statuses (now on `tasks` table)

### Data Migration Notes
- Old `updates` table data remains for historical reference
- New submissions use `task_statuses` table
- Manual data migration script would be needed to move historical data
- Consider the mapping: `status='submitted'` → `lead_review_status='pending'`

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Historical Data**: Old submissions in `updates` table are not automatically migrated
2. **Draft Functionality**: Current implementation treats drafts same as pending submissions
3. **Edit After Submission**: Users cannot edit submissions after submitting (must wait for rejection)
4. **Report Month Lock**: No mechanism to prevent submissions for past months

---

## Next Steps (Phase 6 & 7)

### Phase 6 Enhancements
- [ ] Implement edit policy toggle for leads
- [ ] Add ability to edit narratives before approval

### Phase 7: PM/APM Reporting
- [ ] Create PM/APM review interface
- [ ] Implement Approve/Approve with Changes/Reject workflow
- [ ] PDF generation and storage
- [ ] Month/Contract locking mechanism
