## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure Phase 6 test data is set up (see `PHASE6_STATUS.md`)
2. Create a Report Approver user in Supabase Auth:
   - Email: `approver@example.com`
   - Password: `TestPassword123!`
   - Check "Auto Confirm User"
3. Add to `.env` file:
   ```
   TEST_APPROVER_EMAIL=approver@example.com
   TEST_APPROVER_PASSWORD=TestPassword123!
   ```

### Setup Report Approver Profile

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Get the approver user ID
DO $$
DECLARE
    approver_id uuid;
    contract_id uuid;
BEGIN
    -- Get approver user ID
    SELECT id INTO approver_id
    FROM auth.users
    WHERE email = 'approver@example.com';
    
    -- Get a contract ID (use existing contract)
    SELECT id INTO contract_id
    FROM public.contracts
    LIMIT 1;
    
    -- Create profile
    INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, full_name, role, is_active)
    VALUES (approver_id, 'approver@example.com', 'Test Approver', 'Report Approver', true)
    ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE
    SET role = 'Report Approver', full_name = 'Test Approver';
    
    -- Assign PM role for the contract
    INSERT INTO public.user_contract_roles (user_id, contract_id, role)
    VALUES (approver_id, contract_id, 'PM')
    ON CONFLICT (user_id, contract_id, role) DO NOTHING;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Report Approver setup complete';
END $$;
```

### Create Test Report

Run this SQL to create a test monthly report:

```sql
-- Create a monthly report for testing
DO $$
DECLARE
    contract_id uuid;
    report_month date;
BEGIN
    -- Get a contract ID
    SELECT id INTO contract_id
    FROM public.contracts
    LIMIT 1;
    
    -- Use current month
    report_month := date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE);
    
    -- Create monthly report
    INSERT INTO public.monthly_reports (contract_id, report_month, pm_review_status)
    VALUES (contract_id, report_month, 'pending')
    ON CONFLICT (contract_id, report_month) DO NOTHING;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Test report created for contract % and month %', contract_id, report_month;
END $$;
```
