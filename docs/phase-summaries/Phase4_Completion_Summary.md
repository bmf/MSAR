# Phase 4 Completion Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Phase:** Dashboard Enhancements - Global Filters & Role-Based Landing Views

---

## Overview

Phase 4 focused on enhancing the dashboard with global filters and implementing role-based landing views with route guards. This phase ensures users see appropriate content based on their role and can filter data across the contract hierarchy.

---

## Completed Tasks

### Task 4.5: Global Filters (Contract → Team → PWS Line Item → Task)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Implementation Details:**
- Added filter bar with cascading dropdowns for Contract, Team, PWS Line Item, and Task
- Implemented filter persistence using localStorage
- Filters cascade properly: selecting a contract populates teams, selecting a team populates PWS items, etc.
- Filter selections persist across page navigation and reloads
- Integrated with existing status and sort filters

**Files Modified:**
- `public/src/app.js` - Added global filter UI, state management, and event handlers

**Key Functions:**
- `populateGlobalFilters()` - Populates filter dropdowns from user's assigned tasks
- `updateTeamFilter()` - Fetches and populates teams for selected contract
- `updatePWSFilter()` - Fetches and populates PWS line items for selected contract
- `updateTaskFilter()` - Fetches and populates tasks for selected PWS line item
- `applyFilterSort()` - Applies all filters including global filters to task list

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Filter bar present on dashboard
- ✅ Changing Contract filters Team/PWS/Task options
- ✅ Selections persist during navigation
- ✅ Filters work correctly with v3 schema (contracts, tasks, task_assignments)

---

### Task 4.6: Role-Based Landing Views

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Implementation Details:**
- Implemented role-based routing in the main router function
- Users are automatically directed to appropriate views based on their role:
  - **Admin** → Admin Panel
  - **Report Approver** → Monthly Reporting view
  - **Team Lead** → Team Lead Dashboard
  - **Team Member** → My Tasks (member dashboard)
- Added route guards to prevent unauthorized access
- Access denied messages shown when users attempt to access restricted views

**Files Modified:**
- `public/src/app.js` - Updated router, added role-based views, updated navigation

**Key Functions:**
- `router()` - Enhanced with role-based routing and access control
- `initializeMemberDashboard()` - Renamed from `initializeDashboard()`, shows "My Tasks"
- `initializeTeamLeadDashboard()` - New function for Team Lead landing page
- `initializeReportingView()` - New function for PM/APM landing page
- `updateUI()` - Updated to show role-appropriate navigation links

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ On login, users route to appropriate view based on role
- ✅ Manual route guard prevents access to restricted views
- ✅ Access denied messages displayed for unauthorized access attempts
- ✅ Navigation menu shows only links user has permission to access

---

## Schema Updates

Phase 4 uses the v3 schema introduced in Phase 1:
- `contracts` - Multi-contract support
- `pws_line_items` - PWS line items scoped to contracts
- `teams` - Teams scoped to contracts
- `tasks` - Tasks linked to PWS line items
- `task_assignments` - Many-to-many user-task assignments

**Data Fetching:**
- Updated `fetchTasksAndUpdates()` to use v3 schema with proper joins
- Fetches tasks via `task_assignments` table
- Includes contract, PWS line item, and team information in results

---

## Testing

**Test File:** `tests/phase4.spec.js`

**Test Coverage:**
1. **Global Filters Suite** (6 tests)
   - Filter bar visibility
   - Contract filter population
   - Cascading filter behavior
   - Filter persistence in localStorage
   - Filter restoration on reload
   - Task filtering based on selections

2. **Role-Based Landing Views Suite** (9 tests)
   - Admin routes to Admin Panel
   - Team Lead routes to Team Lead Dashboard
   - Team Member routes to My Tasks
   - Report Approver routes to Reporting View
   - Access control for Team Member (Admin Panel, Review Queue)
   - Access control for Team Lead (Admin Panel)
   - Team Lead can access Review Queue
   - Admin can access all views

3. **Navigation Menu Suite** (4 tests)
   - Team Member sees appropriate nav links
   - Team Lead sees appropriate nav links
   - Report Approver sees appropriate nav links
   - Admin sees all nav links

**Total Tests:** 19

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Contextual Dashboards:**
   - Each role sees a dashboard tailored to their responsibilities
   - Reduces confusion and improves workflow efficiency

2. **Powerful Filtering:**
   - Users can drill down from contract level to specific tasks
   - Filters persist, reducing repetitive selections
   - Cascading filters ensure only valid options are shown

3. **Clear Access Control:**
   - Users cannot accidentally access unauthorized areas
   - Clear error messages when access is denied
   - Navigation menu only shows accessible links

4. **Improved Navigation:**
   - Role-based navigation reduces clutter
   - Quick access to relevant features
   - Consistent user experience across roles

## Technical Notes

### Filter State Management
```javascript
state.globalFilters = {
    contract: '',
    team: '',
    pws: '',
    task: ''
}
```

Stored in localStorage as `msr_global_filters` for persistence.

### Route Guards
The router checks user role before rendering each view:
```javascript
if (userRole === 'Admin') {
    initializeAdminPanel();
} else {
    $('#main-content').html('<div class="alert alert-danger">Access Denied</div>');
}
```

### Cascading Filter Logic
1. User selects Contract → clears Team/PWS/Task filters
2. Fetches teams for selected contract
3. User selects Team → clears PWS/Task filters
4. Fetches PWS items for selected contract
5. User selects PWS → clears Task filter
6. Fetches tasks for selected PWS line item

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Team Filter:** Currently fetches teams by contract, but doesn't filter tasks by team membership (will be implemented in Phase 5 when team-task relationships are fully established)

2. **Placeholder Views:** Team Lead Dashboard and Reporting View show placeholder content with notes about future implementation

3. **Old Schema Support:** The `updates` table still uses the old schema; will be migrated to `task_statuses` in Phase 5

---

## Next Steps (Phase 5)

1. Implement report-month handling for task status submissions
2. Add multi-assignee awareness to task displays
3. Update status submission to use `task_statuses` table
4. Implement task assignment functionality for Team Leads
5. Complete Team Lead Dashboard with full task management
