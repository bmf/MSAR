# Phase 6 Completion Summary

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Phase:** Team Lead Review  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Phase 6 implements the Team Lead Review functionality, allowing team leads to review, approve, reject, or modify task update submissions from their team members.

## Implemented Features

### 6.1 Review Queue View ✅
- Created a dedicated Review Queue page accessible at `/#review`
- Displays pending submissions filtered by team lead's team
- Shows table with columns: Task Name, Submitted By, Submitted At, % Complete, Short Status, Actions
- Navigation link appears only for Team Lead and Admin roles
- Empty state message when no pending submissions exist

### 6.2 Review Detail Panel ✅
- Modal dialog for reviewing individual submissions
- Displays full submission details including:
  - Task name
  - Submitted by (team member name)
  - Submission timestamp
  - Narrative, % Complete, Blockers, Short Status
- Editable fields allow team lead to modify submission before approving
- Comments field for feedback to team member
- Three action buttons:
  - **Approve** - Approves submission as-is
  - **Approve with Changes** - Saves modifications and approves
  - **Reject** - Requires comments, sends back to team member

### 6.3 Approval Logic ✅
- Updates `updates` table status field:
  - `submitted` → `approved` (on approve)
  - `submitted` → `rejected` (on reject)
- Creates records in `approvals` table with:
  - `update_id` - reference to the update
  - `approver_id` - team lead's user ID
  - `status` - 'approved', 'modified', or 'rejected'
  - `comments` - optional feedback
