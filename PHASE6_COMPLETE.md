### ✅ 6.3 - Update Approval Logic
**Status:** Complete  
**Acceptance Criteria:** Approved or rejected updates create entries in approvals; UI reflects state change.

**Implementation:**
- **Approve:** Sets `lead_review_status = 'approved'`, records reviewer ID and timestamp
- **Approve with Changes:** Updates narrative/percent/blockers before approval
- **Reject:** Requires comments, sets `lead_review_status = 'rejected'`
- Records: `lead_reviewer`, `lead_reviewed_at`, `lead_review_comment`
- Updates task's `status_short` when approving
- Auto-queues approved statuses to `report_queue` table

**Tests Passing:**
- ✅ Should require comments when rejecting a submission
- ✅ Should approve submission successfully
- ✅ Should approve submission with changes
- ✅ Should reject submission with comments

**Acceptance Criteria:** Playwright verifies permission checks, approve/reject actions, and UI refresh behavior.

**Implementation:**
- 11 comprehensive Playwright tests

### ✅ 6.5 - Auto-Queue Approved Statuses
**Status:** Complete (Bonus feature from Phase 5)  
**Acceptance Criteria:** On Approve, a row is added to `report_queue` for (contract_id, report_month, task_status_id). Unique constraint prevents duplicates; rejection requires comment.

**Implementation:**
- Automatically adds approved statuses to `report_queue` table
- Fetches `contract_id` from task → pws_line_item relationship
- Includes: `contract_id`, `report_month`, `task_status_id`
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate queue entries
- Silently handles duplicate errors (PostgreSQL code 23505)
- Rejection validation enforces required comments

**Verified:** Working correctly in approve workflow tests

---

### ⏭️ 6.6 - Edit Policy Toggle (Optional)
**Status:** Deferred  
**Acceptance Criteria:** Feature flag controls whether leads can edit narratives prior to approval.

**Decision:** Deferred as optional feature. Current implementation allows leads to edit narratives via "Approve with Changes" action. Can be enhanced later if needed.
