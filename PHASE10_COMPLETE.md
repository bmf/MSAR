# Phase 10 Complete: DevOps & CI/CD

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview
Phase 10 establishes continuous deployment from GitHub to Vercel. When the main branch is updated, the application automatically deploys to production. Pull requests trigger preview deployments for testing before merge.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 10.1 Configure Environment Variables on Vercel
- **Status:** Ready for configuration
- **Action Required:** Set the following environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
  - `SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
  - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key
  - Apply to both **Production** and **Preview** environments

### ✅ 10.2 Implement Continuous Deployment
- **Status:** Complete
- **Implementation:**
  - Created `.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml`
  - Automatic deployment on push to `main` branch (production)
  - Preview deployments on pull requests
  - No test execution during deployment (tests run locally only)

### ✅ 10.3 Add CI Test Workflow
- **Status:** Skipped by design
- **Rationale:** Per requirements, Playwright tests should only be run locally, not as part of CI/CD pipeline

### ✅ 10.4 Database Migration Workflow
- **Status:** Documented
- **Implementation:**
  - Migration scripts exist in `database/migrations/`
  - Apply with: `node database/apply-phase1-migrations.js` (or appropriate phase script)
  - All v3 schema migrations are in place

### ✅ 10.5 Secrets & Storage Config on Vercel
- **Status:** Documented
- **Note:** Storage bucket configuration not required - PDF reports are generated client-side and downloaded directly

## Files Created

### 1. `.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml`
GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Triggers on push to `main` (production deploy)
- Triggers on pull requests (preview deploy)
- Uses Vercel CLI for deployment
- Does NOT run Playwright tests

### 2. `vercel.json`
Vercel configuration that:
- Serves static files from `public/` directory
- Implements SPA routing (all routes → `index.html`)
- Adds security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
- No build command (static HTML/JS/CSS app)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Vercel account connected to GitHub repository
2. Vercel project created for this repository

### Required GitHub Secrets
Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

1. **VERCEL_TOKEN**
   - Generate from Vercel dashboard: Settings → Tokens
   - Scope: Full access to deploy

2. **VERCEL_ORG_ID** (if using Vercel CLI locally)
   - Found in Vercel project settings

3. **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID** (if using Vercel CLI locally)
   - Found in Vercel project settings

### Required Vercel Environment Variables
Add in Vercel dashboard (Settings → Environment Variables):

1. **SUPABASE_URL**
   - Value: Your Supabase project URL
   - Environments: Production, Preview

2. **SUPABASE_ANON_KEY**
   - Value: Your Supabase anonymous/public key
   - Environments: Production, Preview

## Deployment Flow

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Push to main branch
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# 1. Checks out code
# 2. Installs Vercel CLI
# 3. Pulls Vercel environment info
# 4. Builds project artifacts
# 5. Deploys to production
```

### Preview Deployment
```bash
# Create pull request
git checkout -b feature-branch
git push origin feature-branch
# Open PR on GitHub

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# 1. Creates preview deployment
# 2. Comments PR with preview URL
# 3. Updates preview on each push to PR branch
```

## Testing Strategy

### Local Testing Only
Per PRD requirements, Playwright tests are run **locally only**:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/auth.spec.js

# Run with UI
npx playwright test --ui

# Run in headed mode
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Why No CI Tests?
- Tests require local Supabase instance or test database
- Faster deployment without test execution
- Developers responsible for running tests before pushing
- Maintains separation between deployment and testing concerns

## Verification

### After First Deployment
1. ✅ Visit production URL (provided by Vercel)
2. ✅ Verify login page loads
3. ✅ Check browser console for errors
4. ✅ Confirm Supabase connection works
5. ✅ Test authentication flow

### Monitoring
- Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
- Review deployment logs for any errors
- Monitor Supabase dashboard for API usage

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **10.1:** Environment variables documented for Vercel configuration
- [x] **10.2:** GitHub Actions workflow deploys main branch to production automatically
- [x] **10.2:** Pull requests trigger preview deployments
- [x] **10.3:** No test execution in CI/CD (tests local only)
- [x] **10.4:** Database migration workflow documented
- [x] **10.5:** Vercel configuration includes security headers

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Add GitHub Secrets:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/bmf/MSAR/settings/secrets/actions
   - Add `VERCEL_TOKEN`

2. **Configure Vercel Environment Variables:**
   - Go to Vercel project settings
   - Add `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Apply to Production and Preview environments

3. **Test Deployment:**
   - Push this commit to main branch
   - Monitor GitHub Actions workflow
   - Verify successful deployment on Vercel

### Phase 11: QA Testing
Once deployment is verified, proceed with comprehensive Playwright test suite development.

## Notes

- **No Build Step:** Application is static HTML/JS/CSS, no build process needed
- **Client-Side Only:** All logic runs in browser, Supabase handles backend
- **Security:** Environment variables never exposed in client code (loaded server-side if needed)
- **Rollback:** Use Vercel dashboard to rollback to previous deployment if issues arise
